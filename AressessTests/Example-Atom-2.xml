    <title>Why the creators of 'Halo' left Microsoft to make 'Destiny'</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;p&gt;Bungie's sci-fi shooter (and sort-of MMO)Â &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/31/5949297/destiny-beta-preview"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Destiny&lt;/i&gt; held an open beta this past weekend&lt;/a&gt; for all home consoles (PlayStation 4, PS3, Xbox One, and Xbox 360) simultaneously. It's an ambitious game for the team that created &lt;i&gt;Halo&lt;/i&gt;, joined Microsoft, and subsequently split from the company to make this multi-platform game (signing a 10-year deal with publisher Activision Blizzard in the process). We talked withÂ &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.polygon.com/"&gt;Polygon Editor-in-chief Chris Grant&lt;/a&gt; for more on the impact of the beta and why Bungie left and how important this $500 million project is for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>'The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water' trailer will fry your mind</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/36342232/spongebob-movie-screengrab.0_standard_800.0.png" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;In case you've been living in a pineapple under the sea for the better part of two decades, you should know thatÂ &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.nick.com/spongebob-squarepants/"&gt;Spongebob Squarepants&lt;/a&gt; is an enormously popular animated series on Nickelodeon about a talking yellow sea sponge created by aÂ &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/opinion/sunday/stephen-hillenburg.html?_r=0"&gt;marine biology teacher&lt;/a&gt;.Â &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345950/?ref_=tt_rec_tt"&gt;Ten years ago&lt;/a&gt;, it was made into a movie that combined animation and live action. Now, we are getting the requisite sequel: &lt;i&gt;The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water &lt;/i&gt;will wash into US theaters on February 6th, 2015.Â But based on theÂ &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/XwTf3xiBG28"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; released today, the sequelÂ is going several leagues of crazy above and beyond its predecessor, taking Spongebob and his beloved crew of sea creatures and turning them into buff, 3D monstrosities. They face off on land against Antonio...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why chefs love to hate Yelp</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/36340220/theverge1_1020.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;Having your livelihood dependent on the goodwill of a group of anonymous strangers is enough to give anyone a complex. In this piece for &lt;a href="http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-toxic-abusive-addictive-supportive-codependent-relationship-between-chefs-an?"&gt;San Francisco Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, a group of chefs explain their broken relationship to Yelp and the legions of reviewers who control whether their businesses live or die. While Yelp can help people find new restaurants (or can help a city track &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/22/5741428/yelp-reviews-help-nyc-health-dept-track-down-foodborne-illness"&gt;food poisoning&lt;/a&gt;), chefs obsess over reviews and many wish the service didn't exist at all. "If two or three days go by and business sucks, I'll go, âShit, I got a bad review on Yelp.'" says Jeff Mason, the owner of a sandwich shop in San Francisco. The anonymous system, the lack of control on fake reviews, and the difficulty engaging with reviewer has put restaurateurs in...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly paying internet providers to ensure speedy delivery of its data</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/36337296/AppleHQ2_2040.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;Apple has apparently turned on its new content-delivery network, and isÂ &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/2014/07/apples-cdn-now-live.html"&gt;reportedly paying Comcast&lt;/a&gt; and other big ISPs to move hardware into their data center and build direct interconnects to their networks. This is the exact same evolution that Netflix has been going through, building out its own CDN and agreeing to pay ISPs for interconnection. The major difference is that Netflix has loudly opposed the fact that ISPs can charge a fee for this arrangement, while Apple has stayed mum on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;

    <title>Google reveals which countries have used the 'right to beÂ forgotten' most frequently</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/36336870/google-logo-stock-11_2040.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;Google's finding that a lot of people have things they'd rather others forget about. In just about the first month and half that it was accepting requests for links to be removed under Europe's controversial new "right to be forgotten law," Google says that it received over 91,000 submissions, asking that overÂ 328,000 links be removed. Google doesn't say exactly how many of those requests it's fulfilled â and it sounds as though it hasn't even gotten to take a look at all of them yet either â but it does say that of those that it's looked at, just over half of the links have been accepted and removed.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three maps that show Tesla's plan to blanket the world in superchargers</title>

      &lt;p&gt;There are 121,446 gas stations in the United States (as of 2012). Together they employ nearly a million people and do almost $250 billion in annual sales. But they can all trace their origins back to one, in Missouri, built in 1905 with a gardening hose. What began as a side business for a handful of pharmacies became a massive industry because Henry Ford's Model T quickly became so popular that there was suddenly stable demand for everything from gas stations to mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now, Elon Musk and...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Oculus Rift dev kit uses front of a Galaxy Note 3 as its screen</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/36334422/Screen_Shot_2014-07-31_at_3.38.54_PM.0_standard_800.0.png" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;It doesn't get much more "off-the-shelf" than this: the new Oculus Rift developer kit uses the front half of Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 for a display. Samsung's logo is in its usual spot, and the frame even has slots where the phablet's home button, earpiece speaker, and various sensors would normally go.Â &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Oculus+Rift+Development+Kit+2+Teardown/27613" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit made the discovery&lt;/a&gt; while tearing downÂ &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5524972/oculus-reveals-virtual-reality-development-kit-2-announced"&gt;the Rift Dev Kit 2&lt;/a&gt;, which is now making its way to developers who ordered the VR headset earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And while it's a strange thing to see, the decision to use a Samsung component that's already rolling off the assembly line makes total sense.Â It's less costly than producing a custom panel â which we don't expect to see until the consumer Rift arrives â and the Note 3's 1080p Super...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>San Francisco Airport testing beacon system for blind travelers</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/36327306/untitled-12.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;San Francisco Airport is testing out location-aware beacons to help visually-impaired people navigate around one of its newest terminals, a program it could roll out to the rest of the airport if successful. An early version of the system was shown off to press today for use on Apple iOS devices, though SFO also plans to make it available for Android users and eventually expand the system to serve up information for those who can see.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The original Game BoyÂ &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy" target="_blank"&gt;turns 25 today&lt;/a&gt;.Â But short of owning an original device or buying the games again on the 3DS eShop, your best bet for reliving &lt;i&gt;Super Mario Land&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;PokÃ©mon Red &lt;/i&gt;is to useÂ &lt;a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/26/5245864/openemu-mac-elegant-open-source-video-game-emulator" target="_blank"&gt;emulators&lt;/a&gt;. The portable nature of the games and the relatively low hardware requirements needed to emulate Nintendoâs handhelds have made them a perfect fit for modern-day smartphones. While Android users have a variety of choices for emulation, the legally gray area of emulators has kept any apps from making it to Appleâs App Store, leaving apps like gpSPhone and GBA.emu limited only to jailbroken iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu now lets you watch free TV shows and movies on Android</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/36326904/theverge1_1020.0_standard_800.0.jpg" /&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;Hulu is finally starting to let viewers watch TV shows on their phones and tablets without paying for a subscription. Beginning on Android today, just about everything that you can currently watch for free on Hulu's website can now be watched for free on mobile devices. Hulu says that there are some exceptions to what you can watch, but it doesn't say what those are and makes it sound as though it isn't much. The changes come alongside an update to its Android app, which isÂ &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hulu.plus&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;now available in the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Until now, Hulu has put strict walls around where it lets viewers watch TV shows and movies. If you weren't a subscriber, you were limited to the desktop when it came to watching a full episode â meaning that you had to...&lt;/p&gt;
